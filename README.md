An implication is the compound statement of the form “if p, then q.” It is denoted p⇒q, which is read as “p implies q.” It is false only when p is true and q is false, and is true in all other situations.

p	q	p⇒q
T	T	T
T	F	F
F	T	T
F	F	T
The statement p in an implication p⇒q is called its hypothesis, premise, or antecedent, and q the conclusion or consequence.

Implications come in many disguised forms. There are several alternatives for saying p⇒q. The most common ones are

p implies q,
p only if q,
q if p,
q, provided that p.
All of them mean p⇒q.

Implications play a key role in logical argument. If an implication is known to be true, then whenever the hypothesis is met, the consequence must be true as well. This is why an implication is also called a conditional statement.
